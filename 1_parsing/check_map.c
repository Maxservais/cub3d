- The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, and
N, S, E or W for the playerâ€™s start position and spawning orientation.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return an error.
- The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the map and are up to you to handle.
- You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the rules of the map.
